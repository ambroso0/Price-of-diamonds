# Price-of-diamonds

This study was conducted to explore how price is related to various diamond properties. For this reason, we used a dataset from the Blue Nile website containing the properties of more than 1,200 diamonds as well as their prices. The properties in this study are carat, clarity, color, and cut (referred to collectively as the 4Cs). The study also addresses several claims that are made by Blue Nile or held by the public.
